## Why‚ùì
*Training a model can be a long long process!*

In the meantime, have a bit of fun with a **competitive space invaders game**.

See if you can get your name to the top of the *leaderboard*.

## Getting started üèÅ
1. Install the game:
`!pip3 install train_invaders --upgrade`
2. Import the game in your notebook:
`import train_invaders.start`
3. Start training your model. The game will automatically pop up when the process begins.
4. **Play the game!** *You'll get notified when your training is finished*.
5. Want to stop the game from popping up when the model is being trained?
`import train_invaders.stop` will do the work.

## How it works ‚öôÔ∏è
**Tons of magic**... Just kidding :)

When importing the `start` module, its code will be executed.

The code utilizes python's `settrace` function which follows the functions' call stack.

When a function named `fit` `train` or `train_on_batch` is called - using Jupyter notebook's kernel, aka, `IPython`, a javascript view code will be injected inside the output block as an `iframe` to keep it completely **isolated from your code**.

When importing the `stop` module, the `settrace` function will be canceled and the function hooks will be removed.

## FAQ üôã
### Will it interfere with the training process somehow?

NO. The game will start and be played **in parallel to the training** and will even *let you know when the training is finished*.

## Drawbacks ü•∫
* Training stop indication is only in Jupyter Notebook. Want to get notified by email or text? Try [MLNotify](https://mlnotify.aporia.com/)
* Authentication, and therefore, saving your score can only be done from `localhost` and port `8888 - 8891 / 8080 / 8081`

## Contribute ü§ù
Have an awesome idea for a new feature? PRs are more than welcome!

1. Clone the project
2. Implement your idea
3. Made changes in the game? re-compile it with `make build-game`
4. Run `pip install . --upgrade`
5. Test the changes in your notebook
6. PR us!
